The density function of the empirical density of eigenvalues when the dimensions of the matrix tend to 
infinity with finite aspect ratio (approximated with the histograms), has a closed 
form which is asymptotically exact, and is called the Marchenko-Pastur density. If you search on the 
internet for plots of this density, you should recognize the result from the previous question. This is one of 
the foundational results of random matrix theory.
