The density function of the empirical density of eigenvalues when the dimensions of the matrix tend to 
infinity with finite aspect ratio, which is what you are approximating with the histograms, has a closed 
form which is asymptotically exact, and is called the Marchenko-Pastur density. If you look on the 
internet for plots of this density, you should recognize the result from the last question. This is one of 
the foundational results of random matrix theory.
